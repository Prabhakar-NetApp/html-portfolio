<h1>The best Movie according to Prabhakar</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Swades</h3>

<p>This is my one of favourate movie. I watch this movie when I was 7 year old but didn't <br>
   understand the meaning and message behind movie.but as I'm mature enought to understand <br>
    how much great is this movie.</p>

<h3>Veer-Zara</h3>

<p>again this is one of best movie. and very beautiful message give about love. If you love somebody<br>
     then there is no conditions and if you love somebody then you have to beleive in him/her or wait<br>
      for him or her because at the end god will do everything better than your thinking  </p>

<h3>Ashoka</h3>

<p>Sometimes you do lots of wrong things to achive something but it is not the right way. and it's also based on<br>
     true story and they give this message very beautifully.and that's why<br>
     "Kabhi kabhi kuch pane ke liye harna padta hai or harke jitne wale ko bajigar kehte hain" </p>

<h2>And many more movies but for now this is enough.....</h2>
